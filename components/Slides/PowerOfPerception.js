          I acknowledge that when I feel upset, it is because the world is not
          going my way or I feel threatened. I am willing to spend some time
          working on owning my upset. No one can make me feel a certain way. I
          no longer want to give my power away to others, and then blame them
          for taking it. I want more control in my life.

            Whomever you have placed in charge of your feelings, you have placed
            in charge of you. Remember, it is the perception of an experience
            that creates your feelings about it, not the event itself. (p 87)

            We use lecture and reasoning to tell them how their behavior has
            hurt others and will not be tolerated. We attempt to make them feel
            bad on the inside, hoping they will change on the outside. None of
            this puts children in touch with their own emotional guidance.
            Instead, it overrides it with a misguided socialization process. We
            tell them how they should feel instead of encouraging them to be
            aware of what they are feeling.

            Out of control adults focus on what they donâ€™t want to happen. They
            see only from their own point of view. They punish or reward rather
            than teach.
