        With the pause we can name and manage our inner states so we can be the

          <ListItem>Define Self Regulation:</ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            The conscious and unconscious ability to regulate our thoughts,
            feelings and actions in service of a goal. Healthy self-regulation
            is related to the capacity to tolerate the sensations of distress
            that accompany an unmet need.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Our capacity for conscious and voluntary self-regulation gives us
            control over primitive instincts and survival reactions.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>Self-regulation is a higher order skill.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Discipline in early childhood requires us to help children advance
            from lower brain centers of emotional reactions to higher brain
            centers that allow them to respond to the situational demands of
            that moment.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            We are able to teach children how to self-regulate by developing the
            pause between a stimulus and a response.
